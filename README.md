# VanDerWaerden
#
# Van Der Waerden's theorem states that, for any pair of positive integers r and l, there exists a positive integer n such that if m >= n, then any r-coloring
# of the interval {1, 2, ..., m} contains a monochromatic arithmetic progression of length l. The minimal value of n for a given pair r and l is called a 
# Van Der Waerden number V(r, l). This program takes in r and l as inputs and calculates V(r, l), though this process may take a very long time.
#
# It is also important to note that for any meaningful results, one needs to allot java a large amount of memory space.
